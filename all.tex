\begin{abstract}
This document is a slightly edited version of the materials distributed in the "Practical Programming" seminar, a university-wide free research seminar offered at the University of Tokyo's College of Arts and Sciences until 2019. It has been formatted for self-study purposes.

In order to learn programming and algorithms, it is useful not only to read textbooks but also to actually create programs. Fortunately, there are online judge systems, both domestically and internationally, that automatically determine the "correctness" of created programs, and excellent self-study environments are being developed. This document was prepared with the intention of lowering the barrier to learning with these systems and helping beginners experience the fun of problem-solving. For example, most of the example problems have hints that can be completed by filling in blanks or translating pseudo-code written in Japanese into C++.

If you understand the basic syntax of a programming language, it is expected that you will develop the ability to write programs without hints, while understanding the flow of methods by following the hints, and gaining experience such as testing the correctness of programs with input/output data. This document itself is still under development in various aspects, but since there are few readily available materials at present, it has been made public since 2013 in the hope that it may be useful.

\begin{itembox}[r]{-}
The author became aware of the existence of contest-style programming when an independent "study group" (which later became "Practical Programming" in the winter semester) was started by Associate Professor Masuhara (then) in the summer semester of 2004. Since then, the activities of the ACM-ICPC OB/OG Association, the exchange of technology on blogs, the publication of the Japanese online judge system (Aizu Online Judge), the holding of original contests at various universities, the publication of the Programming Contest Challenge Book, and the regular contests of atcoder, etc., have significantly increased the excitement of the Japanese participant community. Since the learning environment at a certain level or higher seems to be well-developed by now, we hope that it will develop further if we can improve the learning efficiency so that inexperienced people can reach an enjoyable level more quickly.
