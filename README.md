# icpcseminar
This is a collection of materials prepared primarily for practical programming.

## Translation

The translation was made using gemini 2.0 and some manual fixing of the errors.

There was no editing or quality control meaning:
- parts could be repeated or missing
- the versionalpha command was probably misused
- a graph is absent

At the moment this translation should be considered an experiment: it might allow you to read
this text, but it does not make reading a pleasant experience.
  
## History
The collection is primarily composed of problems gathered up to around 2014.
Subsequently, it was organized to allow for some learning in Python as well.

Things left undone:
- New problems should be added, and it might be better to remove problems from POJ.
- There are chapters that remain unfinished.
- If you include the line \includecomment{versionalpha}, you can view these sections.
